# What is this?
It's an online theme creator/viewer for theme files in Project Arrhythmia (.lst/.vgt)

The idea is that you can create and edit themes online using this. Except right now all you can do is create them because it's unfinished and I haven't worked out loading themes yet. 

Future plans:
- Loading theme files
- Support for new theme files (.vgt)
- Some sort of theme preview
- Making it not look really bad
