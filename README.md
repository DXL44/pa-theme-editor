# What is this?
This is an editor for theme files in Project Arrhythmia - which have the ".lst" file extension. These are the files that determine the color of everything in a custom level - the objects, the background, the players, etc.

The idea is that you can create new and edit existing themes online using this. It doesn't have too many advantages over the base game, but the goal of this isn't to be revolutionary - more of just a way for me to learn more programming and web design stuff.


## Features planned:
[] Support for new theme files (.vgt)
[] Some sort of theme preview
[] Making it not look really bad
[x] Ability to automatically set background objects/certain colors as the background color
[]Potentially, theme generation 

If you have any ideas that aren't here and are interesting, let me know. I'm personally kind of stuck on what else I could implement into this, and I'd love to take on the challenge!
