# What is this?
It's an online theme creator/viewer for theme files in Project Arrhythmia (.lst/.vgt)

The idea is that you can create and edit themes online using this. You can also load 

Future plans:
- Support for new theme files (.vgt)
- Some sort of theme preview
- Making it not look really bad
- Ability to automatically set background objects/certain colors as the background color
- Potentially, theme generation 

If you have any ideas that aren't here and are interesting, let me know.
